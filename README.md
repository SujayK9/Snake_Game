# Snake_Game
This Repository contains the code for basic Snake Game Project.
The Project is developed using Java Data structures for operation and java swing library for UI Interface.

The game developed in 3 classes modular srtruncture.
1.snake.java is only used to drive other functions to run the game. It calls the GameFrame() function for further execution.
2.GameFrame uses the JFrame library and sets up the initial setups required for proper displaying of the Game window.Then it calls GamePanel() function.
3.GamePanel contains all necessary code for building the block. firstly, it sets the diplay winddow using some java swing and awt libraries.
  The logic is built using several arrays,conditional operatons and functions.
  
  Using these classes and functions a simple Snake Game is developed. Thank you for reading.
